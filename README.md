# Project overview
To create a game engine that will operate using a command line interface system like that found in Zork and other text adventure games. The engine itself will read materials in from a properly formated text file to create characters, rooms, events and records to permit a player to complete a given 'adventure'. Additional objectives for this project include producing tools to permit authors to write their own adventure files for the engine.
